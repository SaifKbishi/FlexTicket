## React site to demo FlexTickets site
with dynamic pages according to event type  

Using the https://www.themoviedb.org/ **API**  to fetch movies details witht he ability to filter by genere.  
With ***React Router*** I have implemented these pages:  
Home page, Choose seats/ tickets, Basket, Register, Confirmation, About, Contact  

You can register as new user, select seats, add/remove seat from basket.  
Basket gets updated depending on the current items in the basket.  
All **CRUD** operations are done in the **LocalStorage**

# Things I want to develop:  
1. redirect from crm details to confirmation letter.  
2. creation and sending PDF confirmation letter.  
3. implement CRM login and profile.
